# Udemy's Object Oriented Programming

Notes and practice from the class. Best to check commits to see how this code has changed - for example, this is what started and how it's changed:

1. Bad code: Two lists + a for loop
2. Create an Employee class with two properties instead
3. Create a list with all employees
4. For job titles, add a new property
5. Make it even better by creating a subclass for job titles instead
